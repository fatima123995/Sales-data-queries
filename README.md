# Sales Data Queries

This repository contains SQL queries completed as part of my Data Analysis coursework, focusing on data classification, filtering, and conditional logic applied to sales data from the `FactInternetSales` table.

## Description  
The assignment involves writing SQL queries to categorize sales records based on various business rules such as sales amount ranges, profitability, discount levels, shipping status, and tax evaluation. It demonstrates practical use of `CASE` statements, filtering with `WHERE` clauses, and nested conditions.

## Queries Included  
- Sales amount classification into High, Medium, and Low  
- Profitability check comparing SalesAmount and TotalProductCost  
- Filtering sales based on unit price, discounts, freight, tax, and order quantity  
- Labeling sales as 'Holiday Sale' or 'Regular Sale' based on order date  
- Classification by discount percentage  
- Combining multiple conditions for complex labels like 'High Sale, High Freight'  
- Shipping timeliness and tax level classification  
- Break-even vs profit/loss analysis based on cost and price  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Advanced use of SQL `CASE` expressions  
- Conditional filtering with `WHERE` and logical operators  
- Nested `CASE` statements  
- Data classification for business insights  
- Writing clear, readable SQL for analytical queries

## How to Use  
Open the `.sql` files in any SQL client or database environment connected to the `FactInternetSales` table schema to run and test the queries.
